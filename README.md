# City of Cincinnati Fleet Preventive Maintenance and Repair Work Orders dataset

## OVERVIEW

This is a final capstone project for an on-line Data Analytics course taken at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-analytics/san-francisco). 
The data is a compilation of the [City of Cincinnati Fleet Preventive Maintenance and Repair Work Orders](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Thriving-Neighborhoods/Fleet-Preventative-Maintenance-Repair-Work-Orders/2a8x-bxjm), updated daily, with over 270,000+ rows of unique work orders and 37 columns of features from 2008 to present.

## Motivation

I was looking for data that I could use to showcase my Tableau skills while using past experience in maintenance and reliability. The City of Cincinnati's data set was such a treasure to find as I was also able to connect with the Office of Performance and Data Analytics with questions that were very helpful. My main goal was to focus on determining mean-time-between-failures yet there were also plenty of other avenues to explore as discussed below.

## Technical Aspects
There you'll find a description of the data and a download of the [Data Dictionary](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/api/views/2a8x-bxjm/files/d5a81f3e-b274-44c7-8569-458883d0cc5f?download=true&filename=Fleet%20Preventative%20Maintenance%20&%20Repair%20Work%20Orders-%20Data%20Profile%20-%203b.Data%20Dictionary.pdf).
